title: Don't call it a comeback!

I moved my extremely modest blogging activities from [WordPress](https://sparetimecode.wordpress.com/) to [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/).

Even though I only blog for myself (inspired by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) who says one of the reasons he blogs is to remember things and make it easy to look them up), I found the free version of WordPress had a bit too much clutter.
So blogging in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) it is, doesn't get more minimalistic than this.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
