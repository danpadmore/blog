title: AKS Construction Helper
---

The [AKS Construction Helper](https://azure.github.io/AKS-Construction/) is something very useful [Gitte Vermeiren](https://github.com/vermegi) (Engineer with the FastTrack for Azure team at Microsoft) demonstrated at a [Belgium Kubernetes & Cloud Native Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/kubernetes-belgium/events/286917442/) event.

She explained that while you can use the Azure portal to create an [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) cluster, the wizard is limited in comparison and offers less guidance.

Depending on your project size/ambitions (>= â‚¬5000/month Azure spend), you might also be able to get help and guidance from [FastTrack](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/programs/azure-fasttrack/) to setup your solution, something worth checking out.
