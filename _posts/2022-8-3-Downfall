title: Downfall: The Case Against Boeing
---

Only just now saw [Downfall: The Case Against Boeing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11893274/) streaming on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81272421).
It's a documentary that does a root cause analysis on how two of Boeing's planes crashed. 

This was in the news a couple of years ago ofcourse and much has already been said and done about it.
But still I found it particulary gripping to really have a software issue in a component (the *Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)*) pointed out like that as a major reason of such consequences.

While the software component is not the sole cause (*the documentary lays out the environment and steps that led to this faulty software reaching production*), I still found it a sobering reminder of the critical role software can play in our lives.
As was the case with Volkswagen and Dieselgate, software used in an unethical environment led to real harm.

All this echoes Uncle Bob's call for more professionalism and ethics in our industry, I can only agree.
