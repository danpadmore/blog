title: Don't call it a comeback!

I moved my extremely modest blogging activities from [WordPress](https://sparetimecode.wordpress.com/) to [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com/).

Even though I only blog for myself (inspired by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) who says one of the reasons he blogs is to remember things and make it easy to look them up), I found the free version of WordPress had a bit too much clutter.
So blogging in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) it is, doesn't get more minimalistic than this.


Theme music for this blog post :)
